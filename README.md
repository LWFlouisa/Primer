# Primer
Primer for collaborators.

## Lore Context
This is an alternative history simulation of the evolution of new ethnic group over the centuries.

The cognitive architecture could be thought of as that world mold spawning agent to agent collaboration.

The inspiration came from imagining what a cognitive architecture would be like if border towns after an extensive ethno civil war needed an empathic machine to rebuild safety from the ashes.

The fantasy language this world speaks is a creole that blends Japanese, Francais, Alsatian German, and elements of other languages in the US.

This is reflected in the GUI that in graphical form reads top to bottom and right to left except when borrowing French and German words in groups in the US.

### Help Needed
* Render that ASCII map with actual graphics/colors (maybe the directional text overlaid)
* Display the environmental states in a panel
* Show agent memory/relationships in a sidebar
* Have a text input for "describe what happens next"
* Watch the map and states update
